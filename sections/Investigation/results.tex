\section{Investigating results in context-aware recommender systems}
To establish the usefulness of adding context to recommender systems we will conduct an investigation into recent papers relating to the topic examining the experimental results of different proposed methods.
We will investigate the kinds of context data used in the different papers, how this context data was used and how it was evaluated.
