\subsection{Synthetic data}
 Datasets where the ratings are context-dependent are needed in order to enable testing of context-aware recommender systems.
One approach is to make a semi-synthetic dataset by adding a new contextual feature that the ratings will depend on \cite{baltrunasContextItemSplit}.
For this approach, the idea is to add a new contextual feature \texttt{c} that represents a contextual condition that could affect the rating.
The value of \texttt{c} is either 0 or 1. 
If \texttt{c} is 1, the corresponding rating between 1 and 5 is increased by 1, if it is not already 5.
If \texttt{c} is 0, the rating is instead decreased by 1 if is not already 1.
An $\alpha$ value is then chosen between 0 and 1 which determines the fractions of ratings that are affected by the contextual feature \texttt{c}.
By using this method, one can modify a dataset into being artificially context dependent for testing purposes.
This approach can be seen in \autoref{tab:synthetic-data1} and \autoref{tab:synthetic-data2}.
