\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
This section will describe our experiments and findings regarding utilizing context and graphs in recommender systems.
The section is structured as follows: First we will describe the state-of-the-art and baseline methods that have been investigated in \autoref{subsec:sotaoverview}.
We will then look at various datasets containing context, and briefly describe each of them in \autoref{subsec:desc-of-datasets}.
Following that we will look at various metrics used to evaluate recommender systems in \autoref{sec:evaluationmetrics}, and how these state-of-the-art methods compare to each other and baseline methods using these metrics in \autoref{subsec:resultsofexperiment}.
