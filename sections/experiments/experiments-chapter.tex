\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
With this foundational knowledge about RS, we are now ready to look into some state-of-the-art methods and evaluate them in the following section.\\ 
This section will describe our experiments and findings regarding utilizing context, side-information and graphs in RS.
The section is structured as follows: First we will describe the state-of-the-art and baseline methods that have been investigated in \cref{subsec:sotaoverview}.
We will then look at various datasets containing context, and briefly describe each of them in \cref{subsec:desc-of-datasets}.
Following that we will look at various metrics used to evaluate RS in \cref{sec:evaluationmetrics}, and how these state-of-the-art methods compare to each other and baseline methods using these metrics in \cref{subsec:resultsofexperiment}.
