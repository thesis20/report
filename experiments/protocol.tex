\section{Experiments}
Experiments are carried out in order to gain an understanding of baselines that employ different methods and investigate the impact of contextual data.
This section describes these experiments and the protocol used.

\subsection{Datasets}
Four datasets are considered for experimentation based on the investigation in \autoref{sec:datasetsummary}: \textit{MovieLens 100k}, \textit{LDOS-CoMoDa}, \textit{Frapp√©}, as well as the \textit{Yahoo!} movie dataset of ratings and descriptive content information \cite{yahoo-movie}.
